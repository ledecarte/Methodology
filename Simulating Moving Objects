------------------------------------------ SIMUALTION OF MOVING OBJECTS ----------------------------------------------------------------
Lets put an actual scenario in picture. Generally in valve simulations are done partially open and fully opened with an objective 
to get the pressure contour within the internal system or the pressure drop the system provides or even the flow lines to see 
seperations and velocity at a particular section.

But there are cases where the valves can be opened in realtime in simulation. Where the valve should move its postition with 
respect to time. In a broader picture, all the code understands is that there is grid or stencil where one of the pacthes 
is valve. Hence these meshes should change in real time to simulate the effect of these valve moving. 

Mesh should consistantly change according to the new position without losing the quality of the mesh. 
Which is a tough job!!

 --------- General approaches for the Problem -----------------------------------------------
  1. Moving Mesh (Dynamic Mesh) 
      Suitable for aerodynamic problems where boundary layer is important
        - ALE
        - Remeshing
        - Spring-based Smoothing and Layering
    Note : Sliding Mesh Motion(Slides past the stationary object) is technique well defined for rotation motion such as in turbomachinery, fans, etc. But dyn mesh can handle 
           translation, rotation and deformation. 
  2. Immersed Boundary Method 
      Embedding the boundary of a moving object into a fixed grid and representing the 
      effect of the boundary using source terms in the governing equation.
  3. Overset Grids/Chimera Grids 
      Complex motion where multiple moving bodies with complex trajectories.
  4. Mesh Free Methods
        - Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
        - Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)
  5. Boundary-Conforming Methods
        - Level Set Method (Suitable for FSI)
